    question: "What happens after I submit my product for review?",

    question: "Is my intellectual property safe?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We treat all submissions with the strictest confidence. We will not share your product outside our internal review team without your explicit permission. We are happy to sign an NDA upon request if we proceed."

    question: "What if I have an idea, not a live product?",
    answer: "Since our strategy is to acquire products outright, we will not be able to fund your idea. But if you have high conviction in your idea, we leave you with this: Build Fast. Deploy Fast. Get Customer Feedback. Repeat. Also, in the wise words of Mr. Warren Buffett: “Think about delighting your customers”."

  {
    question: "Do I need to pay any fees?",
